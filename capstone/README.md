Write a command line tool with the following features:

- Implements levelled logging with 2 levels (info & debug)
- Accepts input data from a file or standard input
- Uses machine learning to make predictions based on input data (use Keras,
  Tensorflow, scikit learn as you prefer). Feel free to use an existing model or
  code from an example covered in class
- Able to save and restore it's ML model to/from a file
- BONUS: Build it as a wheel (via poetry) for easy deployment
- BONUS 2: Add unit tests and run them via `pytest`

    "Literate programming is basically a style of programming where code is comprehensively documented, for purposes of achieving fuller understanding and clarity.\n",

    "Open and run the [Get Started with TensorFlow example](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/_index.ipynb), and ADD COMPREHENSIVE COMMENTS to code it so that it's written in a literate style."
